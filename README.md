---

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates **Data Augmentation** techniques using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.  
The notebook `C3W1_Assignment.ipynb` shows how GANs can generate realistic new data samples from limited datasets to enhance model performance and generalization.

This project is part of the **"Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)"** course from **DeepLearning.AI**, led by **Andrew Ng** and **Sharon Zhou**.  
It focuses on practical implementation of GANs for real-world data augmentation tasks.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered

- Basics of **GAN architecture** (Generator & Discriminator)
- Training GANs for **synthetic data generation**
- Comparing **real vs generated** samples
- Using GANs for **data diversity and augmentation**
- Improving ML performance with **augmented datasets**
